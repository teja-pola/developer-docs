Welcome to our Getting Started page. It has all you need to get comfortable with the code base and our community.

## Quick List

Here is a quick guide on getting started with our projects.

1. Watch our YouTube Channel playlist: [Getting Started - Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpBUoHxEeyg&list=PLv50qHwThlJUIzscg9a80a9-HmAlmUdCF&pp=gAQB). It covers important topics such as:
    1. Our community culture
    2. How to create issues
    3. How to get issues assigned to you
    4. Our pull request process
    5. The importance of testing
2. Get familiar with the [important files in each repository](#important-files). They cover details that are excluded in our summary YouTube videos.
3. If you are new to GitHub and collaborative coding then [read our GitHub Quick-Start Guide](../git-guide/quickstart).
4. Research the [GitHub issue trackers for all the projects](../introduction/projects) 
5. Introduce yourself on our `#general` slack channel. You can join our Slack Channel using the link on the [Palisadoes Foundation GitHub Home Page](http://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation).
6.  If you do not see any interesting projects from the proposed ideas or issues, we encourage you to contact the Palisadoes Foundation’s mailing list and propose a new idea. The Palisadoes Foundation does not encourage and will not respond to your personal new open source project ideas which are unrelated to any Palisadoes projects.
7.  You can subscribe to our list at [https://www.freelists.org/list/palisadoes](https://www.freelists.org/list/palisadoes).

| CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | This file contains guidelines of how each contributor in the community should behave and communicate with each other. It also states the consequences of going against these rules. By doing this we aim to provide a harassment-free environment and also an inclusive, healthy and diverse community. |

| PR_GUIDELINES.md | When you are ready submit new code this document will explain what we need in your Pull Request (PR). We take this guide seriously as it tells you how to make sure your code will meet our standards and be accepted. |
